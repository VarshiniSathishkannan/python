High level design tells the services required for a project but Lower level design tells the functionalities of the components used in HLD.

Lower-Level Design (LLD)—also known as Detailed Design—is a phase in software development that focuses on the internal logic and structure of individual modules or components within a system. It translates the high-level architecture into detailed, implementable designs that developers can directly use to write code.

Aspect	        High-Level Design (HLD)	            Lower-Level Design (LLD)
Focus	        Overall architecture and components	Module-level design and internal logic
Audience	    Architects, stakeholders	        Developers
Detail Level	Abstract	                        Detailed
Output	        System architecture, components, technologies	
                                                    Class diagrams, data structures, function logic
Example	Microservices layout, database design	    Class methods, validation logic, API flow


# UML
A UML diagram (Unified Modeling Language diagram) is a standardized visual representation of a system's design, commonly used in software engineering to describe the structure and behavior of a system. UML helps developers and stakeholders understand how a system works, what its components are, and how they interact.

# Types of UML Diagrams
UML diagrams are broadly categorized into two types:

# Structural Diagrams – Describe what a system is made of.

Class Diagram	    Shows classes, attributes, methods, and relationships (like inheritance).
Object Diagram	    Snapshot of the system showing objects and their relationships at a moment.
Component Diagram	Shows high-level software components and their dependencies.
Deployment Diagram	Shows physical deployment of software on hardware (e.g., servers).
Package Diagram	    Organizes classes into packages (namespaces).
Composite Structure Diagram	Shows internal structure of a class.

# Behavioral Diagrams – Describe how the system behaves.

Use Case Diagram	    Shows system functionality from the user's perspective.
Sequence Diagram	    Shows how objects interact over time in a particular scenario.
Activity Diagram	    Flowchart showing the workflow or process. steps involved in acheiving a usecase
State Machine Diagram	Shows state changes of an object in response to events.
Communication Diagram	Interaction between objects with a focus on relationships.
Timing Diagram	        Shows object states and interactions over time (for real-time systems).
