REPL - Read Eval Print Loop

REPL is an interactive programming environment that takes single user inputs, evaluates them, and returns the result to the user. It repeats this process in a loop, which is why itâ€™s called a Readâ€“Evalâ€“Print Loop.

ðŸ”¹ What REPL Does, Step by Step
Read: Takes the user input (e.g., 2 + 3)

Eval: Evaluates the input (calculates 5)

Print: Displays the result (5)

Loop: Goes back and waits for the next input

Without REPL: Slower Workflow
For compiled languages without REPL, you often have to:

Write code

Compile it

Run the compiled output

This slows down experimentation and learning.
